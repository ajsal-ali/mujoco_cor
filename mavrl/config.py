K_SMOOTH = 0.01

#: Speed above which closing on the waypoint stops paying, in the SAME units as
#: the logged `agv` (SDF units/s; the arena is the course x2.2, so 1.3 here is
#: ~0.59 competition m/s). Below the cap the progress term is the usual
#: distance-made-good; above it the per-tick credit is clipped flat.
#:
#: The point is to move the speed incentive to where it belongs. Racing between
#: gates buys nothing and costs control margin on the next bar, so mid-course
#: speed is worth exactly one thing -- arriving. The completion bonus
#: (K_TBONUS, below) stays uncapped, so a *finished* course still pays for
#: every second saved, with no ceiling.
#:
#: Retreating is deliberately NOT clipped: backing away from the waypoint costs
#: the full distance, so the cap cannot be farmed by oscillating.
V_PROG_CAP = 1.3

#: Hard end of the speed band. Between V_PROG_CAP and this, speed is free but
#: unpaid; above it, it costs K_OVERSPEED per unit of excess per policy step.
#:
#: Measured on the HORIZONTAL speed only. Vertical is left alone deliberately:
#: a blue@0.880 -> red@4.356 pair is a 3.9-unit climb inside one 2.20 spacing,
#: so a penalty on total speed would punish the climb the course itself
#: demands. What we are limiting is how fast it travels down the corridor.
#:
#: Applied only while the course is unfinished. Crossing the last gate ends the
#: episode and pays K_TBONUS with no ceiling, so a completed run is still
#: rewarded for every second saved no matter how fast it flew.
V_SPEED_LIMIT = 1.7

#: Penalty per policy step per unit of horizontal speed above V_SPEED_LIMIT.
#:
#: 0.5 puts 2.0 units/s at 0.15/step (0.5/s of flight, ~1.7x K_TIME) and the
#: 3.0 ceiling at 0.65/step (6.5/s, ~22x K_TIME). So drifting just over the
#: line is a nudge and flat out is unaffordable, which is the shape we want:
#: the band is 1.3-1.7, not a wall at 1.7.
K_OVERSPEED = 0.5
K_CENTER = 0.1
CENTER_BAND = 2.2            # apply the centering term within one station spacing

#: Penalty per policy step on |heading error|, radians, against YAW_DOWN_COURSE.
#:
#: Yaw is a real action (a[3], a rate) feeding an integrator with no restoring
#: term, and absolute heading is *not* in the proprio vector -- gravity in the
#: body frame is invariant to rotation about z. So without this the policy has
#: no gradient telling it to hold heading and any constant bias on a[3] just
#: accumulates. Every scripted pilot pins yaw (collect.py:181, teleop.py:111),
#: so BC data never shows the drift and only PPO discovers it.
#:
#: 0.1 puts a 30 deg error at 0.052/step, ~1.7x K_TIME, and a 90 deg error at
#: 0.157/step -- roughly half a second of the time penalty, every step it is
#: held. Firm enough that sustained drift is never worth it, still far short of
#: a hard lock: a brief yaw excursion to line up a bar costs well under one
#: gate. The paper's own config carries the equivalent term (`yaw_coeff:
#: -0.003` in mavrloriginal/configs/control/config_new_out.yaml).
K_YAW = 0.1

R_TOTAL = 150.0              # split evenly across the course's gates
R_FINISH = 100.0

#: Must stay ABOVE the per-gate payout, which is R_TOTAL / n_gates -- 30.0 at
#: stage 3 (5 gates), 37.5 at stage 2, 50.0 at stage 1. At the old 25.0 the
#: arithmetic said to gamble: attempting a marginal gate and crashing scored
#: +5 against stopping safely, so "try it and die" beat "hold position", and
#: the terminal-reason mix filled up with `collision`. At 40.0 a failed attempt
#: costs more than the gate it was reaching for at stage 3, without being so
#: steep that the policy learns to sit still -- hovering to timeout is ~-11.7,
#: so one gate then a crash (-10) is still roughly break-even against doing
#: nothing, and two gates then a crash is clearly better. Watch the
#: terminal-reason mix: `collision` dominating means raise it, `timeout`
#: dominating means it is already too high.
R_CRASH = 40.0

#: Leaving the course *sideways or backwards*. Twice R_CRASH on purpose.
#:
#: These used to cost the same as hitting a bar, which made them
#: interchangeable, and peeling off sideways is the cheaper way to end an
#: episode you have decided is lost: it is available from anywhere, at any
#: speed, while a crash at least requires committing to the gate first. In a
#: real venue they are not interchangeable -- clipping a bar is a failed
#: attempt, leaving the course sideways is a drone in the crowd. 80 makes
#: flying into the obstacle strictly preferable to flying out of the arena.
R_STRAY = 80.0

#: Which terminal reasons R_STRAY applies to, rather than R_CRASH.
#:
#: Deliberately NOT the whole out-of-bounds family. Overshooting forward past
#: the exit, or climbing out of the room, is priced as an ordinary crash: the
#: drone got all the way down the course to do it, and penalising that at the
#: sideways rate would punish exactly the runs that came closest to finishing.
#: What earns the doubled penalty is going somewhere the course never went --
#: out the side, or back the way it came.

K_TBONUS = 5.0

#: Terminate past the entry wall if |x| exceeds this. The red bar spans

#: left the course rather than dodged within it.
CORRIDOR_X_LIMIT = 2.6
