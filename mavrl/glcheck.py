"""Does this box render on the GPU, headless? Answer in ten seconds.

    python -m mavrl.glcheck

A training run that renders in software still *works*, which is the trap: it
finishes, it logs, it just takes a week. So this does not stop at "did a frame
come back" -- it names the renderer string and measures throughput, because the
only symptom distinguishing llvmpipe from an RTX card is the clock.

Four tiers, each one useless to reach if the one before it failed:

  1. environment   MUJOCO_GL, the driver, the EGL vendor ICDs
  2. context       can a GL context be created at all, headless
  3. renderer      *which* GL implementation answered -- GPU or software
  4. course        the real 512x512 offscreen render, at the real settings

Exit code is 0 only when tier 4 renders on hardware. `--allow-software` lowers
that bar to "rendered at all", for a box where you already know what you have.
