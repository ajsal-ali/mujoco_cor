"""MAVRL: memory-augmented, varying-speed RL for the IMAV2026 obstacle course.

Layered so the geometry and gate logic import cleanly without mujoco/torch --
that is what makes them testable on a machine with no simulator installed.

    course_gates  pure geometry: gate planes, traversal outcomes, gate ordering
    course_world  the real IMAV arena (Files(3)/imav2026_scaled.sdf) with the
                  bar stations randomized; layout sampling, semantic class map

Everything above those (env, SeVAE, memory, training) pulls in mujoco or torch.
`course_world`'s XML path additionally needs the SDF and `imav_teleop`, but its
constants and layout sampling do not.
