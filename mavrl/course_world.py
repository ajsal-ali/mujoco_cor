"""The real IMAV2026 arena, with only the bar stations randomized.

The arena is `Files(3)/imav2026_scaled.sdf`, converted to MJCF by
`imav_teleop.SdfToMjcf` and injected into BaseAviary's XML exactly as
`imav_play.make_world_injector` does. Nothing is invented and nothing else is
moved: the entry wall, exit wall, tubes, boxes, turbine, ring board, platforms,
strips and floor are all the competition geometry.

Three things vary between episodes, and only these three:

    * **how many** bar stations are present  (0..3)
    * **which colour** sits at each station   (red / blue, any order)
    * **the bar's height**                    (3 options per colour)

Everything else is fixed. The default stations that ship in the SDF
(`red_bar`, `blue_bar1`, `blue_bar2` and their posts and feet) are skipped
during conversion and re-emitted per layout, at the SDF's own station planes and
with the SDF's own tube radii, post heights and colours.

Scale
-----
The SDF is the competition arena scaled by **2.2x** -- the file name says so and
the numbers confirm it: `red_bar` sits at z = 4.356 = 2.2 x 1980 mm, `blue_bar`
at z = 0.880 = 2.2 x 400 mm, stations 2.20 m apart = 2.2 x 1.0 m. Every constant
in this package is in **SDF units**. The real-world millimetres appear only in
the comments beside the height tables.

That distinction matters: an earlier version of this file mixed the two, taking
the entry-window numbers from the SDF (z ~ 3.4) and the bar heights from the
competition spec (z = 0.4..1.98), which put the drone on a physically wrong 3 m
dive out of every window.

Direction of travel
-------------------
The course runs along **+y**, matching the arena's own `takeoff_platform` at
y = -14.30: the drone enters through the wall at y = -12.10 and leaves through
the one at y = +3.30, meeting red_bar -> blue_bar1 -> blue_bar2 -> tube_B ->
tube_A on the way. The two walls are geometrically identical, so the course is
symmetric and the direction is pure convention -- but it is the competition's
convention, and the bars come *before* the tubes because of it.

`course_gates.TRAVEL_SIGN` is the single source of truth; nothing here or in the
env or the pilot hardcodes a y comparison.
